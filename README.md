# Snake (in C)

I made this over a couple days when I was away. There's not much too it and it's probably _(it is)_ poorly optimized.

I just wanted to say I made a game before, and now I can!

## Note

It does only work on Unix systems, but other than that you can have fun with it...

Maybe if I'm bored I'll make a Windows version.
